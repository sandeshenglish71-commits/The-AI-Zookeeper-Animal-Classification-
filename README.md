# The-AI-Zookeeper-Animal-Classification-
The Goal: I wanted to build an AI that can think like a biologist. My goal was to make a program that can look at an animal's features (like if it has hair, feathers, or lays eggs) and correctly guess what kind of animal it is (Mammal, Bird, Fish, etc.).

What I Did? I used a dataset of 101 animals and built a Decision Tree Model.

Data: I looked at traits for each animal, such as "Has Milk," "Number of Legs," and "Can Fly."

The Model: I chose a Decision Tree because it works like a flowchart. It asks simple questions to find the answer. For example: "Does it have feathers? Yes = Bird."

Visualizing: I created a drawing of the tree so anyone can see exactly how the AI makes its decisions.

What I Learned? This project taught me that simple models are sometimes the best. Unlike complex AI that is hard to understand, the Decision Tree is easy to explain to people. I learned how to turn data into a clear set of rules.
